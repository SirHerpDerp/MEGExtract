# MEGExtract

This python script is able to extract *.MEG files used by Command and Conquer Remastered Collection.

Pass the filename as an argument `python3 MEGExtract.py MUSIC.MEG`, or edit the line `inputFileName = "MUSIC.MEG"`.  
All files will be unpacked to the script's directory (mostly a new folder named \\DATA\\ will be created).

may work with *.MEG files of other games, too.

## Requirements

You only need Python 3.x installed, nothing else
